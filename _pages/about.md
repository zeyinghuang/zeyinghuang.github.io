I am a Ph.D. candidate pursuing a dual major in Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics (AFRE) and Economics at Michigan State University. 



In Fall 2021, I will be joining [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) as Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics.

You can find my job market paper, as well as my other research [here](/research).
